# IBM  Opto-Electronic Device under Uniaxial Stress

IBM  Opto-Electronic Device under Uniaxial Stress is an instrument-control software for studying the optical and electrical transport properties of nanoscale devices subject to mechanical uniaxial stress.

The characterization setup and methodology includes:
- a bending mechanical device;
- the desing of the strain substrate and of the electrical connectors;
- the software for data acquisition;

A thorough description of these setup is described in a peer reviewd paper, submitted in Review of Scientific Instruments (under review, like provided asap): blue prints of the bending mechanics and of the mechanical connectors are described as detailed in the paper as possible, compatibly with IBM procedures.
